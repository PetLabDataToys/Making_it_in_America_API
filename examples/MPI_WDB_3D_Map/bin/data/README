World DataBank, ASCII text version
Dave Pape, dave.pape@acm.org


These files are a plain text version of the CIA World DataBank II.
They are derived from the highly compressed binary version of the
files created by Brian Reid and formerly available from
spectrum.xerox.com.

The format of the files is very simple-minded.  Each "segment" begins
with a line of text similar to the following:
	segment 1  rank 1  points 991
The segment number is just an ID for the segment.  The rank is some sort
of ranking of the size or significance of the segment, with 1 being
the highest rank, 2 the next, and so on; map-drawing software typically
uses this number to control the amount of detail in a map.  The last
number is the number of points forming the segment.  The points themselves
are then listed on the following lines, one per line.  The values for a
point are its latitude and longitude, expressed as a floating point number
of degrees; positive latitude is north of the equator, positive longitude
is east of the prime meridian.  Note that using floating point degrees
rather than the original integer degrees and arc minutes means that some
slight loss of accuracy has been incurred for the sake of convenience.

The files are split up by continent and by the type of data they contain.
The files' contents are:
	africa-bdy	Africa, national boundaries
	africa-cil	Africa, coastlines, islands, and lakes
	africa-riv	Africa, rivers
	asia-bdy	Asia, national boundaries
	asia-cil	Asia, coastlines, islands, and lakes
	asia-riv	Asia, rivers
	europe-bdy	Europe, national boundaries
	europe-cil	Europe, coastlines, islands, and lakes
	europe-riv	Europe, rivers
	namer-bdy	North America, national boundaries
	namer-cil	North America, coastlines, islands, and lakes
	namer-pby	North America, US state & Canadian province boundaries
	namer-riv	North America, rivers
	samer-bdy	South America, national boundaries
	samer-cil	South America, coastlines, islands, and lakes
	samer-riv	South America, rivers

Note that the political boundaries are those of the time that the DataBank
was originally created, sometime in the 1980s.  Also, whoever created the
DataBank considered North America to consist solely of the US and Canada.
